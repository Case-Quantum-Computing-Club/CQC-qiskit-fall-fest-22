# Qiskit Machine Learning demo

This repository contains a demo of the Qiskit Machine Learning library. The demo is a Jupyter notebook that contains two approaches for classification problems: a quantum support vector machine and a hybrid quantum-classical neural network. The demo is based on the [Quantum Kernel Machine Learning tutorial](https://qiskit.org/documentation/machine-learning/tutorials/03_quantum_kernel.html) and [Torch Connector and Hybrid QNNs tutorial](https://qiskit.org/documentation/machine-learning/tutorials/05_torch_connector.html).
