# CWRU Qiskit Fall Fest 2022

## <img src='img/icon_2.png' height=4% width=4% align=center> Welcome
We are super excited to have our first [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest/) event here at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)! The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world, with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill sets in quantum computing. This event is being hosted by the Case Quantum Computing (CQC) Club and supported by IBM Quantum. Please consider joining our club (signup form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1y1zYMXbG8hL9eRnmuG1AYNJ4lgl1B1Lgwy0XtY09aT_8EQ/viewform)) and participating in this event! 

The Fall Fest @ CWRU is going to be a two-week event. The first week (Oct. 10 - 14) will be a series of workshops on quantum computing and [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), and the second week (Oct. 15 - 21) will be a hackathon challenge, with **prizes sponsored by IBM Quantum**. Details about the hackathon and rules can be found below. The deadline for all projects is Oct. 24th, at 12 pm ET. Any projects submitted after that will NOT be judged. Good luck!
